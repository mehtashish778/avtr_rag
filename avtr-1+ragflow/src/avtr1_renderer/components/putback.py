"""Composite the rendered face crop back onto the avatar and matte it.

Calls the MODNet matting engine via ``matte_chunk``. The reference's
variant (see ``putback.py:37`` in the old repo) bundles body-motion
simulation, alpha matting, and per-avatar custom mask paths; the
simplified pipeline keeps just the ``warp_affine + mask blend + matte +
bg-composite`` core.

``putback_chunk`` is the only entry point: it processes all N frames at
once in a single batched warp + blend + matting + composite. Single-
frame callers wrap their face in ``unsqueeze(0)`` and read ``[0]`` from
each output -- there is no per-frame variant, because every op in the
pipeline broadcasts cleanly across the leading dim and the engines
support ``B >= 1``.

Conventions:
- Tensors are NCHW float in ``[0, 1]`` on CUDA.
- ``avatar.mask`` is pre-warped to original-frame coordinates at registration
  time, so the inner loop only does a single warp + blend.
- ``avatar.source`` is the grey-bg portrait composite, so MODNet sees a
  clean foreground / background split.
- ``bg`` is passed in by the caller -- the final background the rendered
  head is composited onto using the predicted alpha matte. Backgrounds
  are a render-time choice (the pipeline keeps a registry keyed by id),
  not part of the avatar's identity.
- The output is ``(rgb, alpha)`` -- separate tensors so consumers can
  drop alpha without paying a slice / cat round-trip.
