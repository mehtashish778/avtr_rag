"""Public dataclasses for the streaming face animation pipeline.

These types form the contract between the orchestrator (`Model.process_chunk`)
and its caller.

Shape philosophy:
- `Avatar` (defined alongside the loader in ``avatar_loader``) is
  **immutable** and built once from a portrait. Carries every
  per-portrait tensor the inner loop needs.
- A "registry" is just a plain ``dict[str, Avatar]`` held wherever it makes
  sense (the orchestrator, the API layer, a process-wide singleton). The
  loader is the producer; the registry is just data.
- `Chunk` is per-call audio (speech + listen tracks).
- The per-session state blob is opaque -- its shape is the motion
  generator's choice (see ``AVTR1State`` in
  ``avtr1_motion_generator``).
- `Frame` is one rendered RGB image, yielded one at a time so the API can
  stream without buffering.

      I420. The renderer composites the head over the avatar's bg using the
      predicted alpha matte before packing, so no separate alpha plane is
      shipped. 1.5 bpp.
    - ``"yuv_i420_stacked_alpha"``: ``(3 H, W)`` uint8 packed
      ``(Y, AY, U, AU, V, AV)``. The buffer is also a valid I420 frame at
      ``(1.5 H, W)`` -- useful for shipping alpha through a stock H.264 /
      VP9 / AV1 pipeline so downstream callers can recomposite over a
      different bg. 3 bpp.

    ``height`` / ``width`` are the *original* color-frame dimensions, not
    the packed buffer's; consumers use them to unpack the planes.

    The renderer pipeline materialises each frame on CPU before yielding,
    so callers can stream without holding references to GPU buffers.

    All defaults preserve the pipeline's previous behaviour, so existing
    call sites can pass ``RenderOptions()`` (or nothing) and observe no
    change. New surface is grouped here so the orchestrator signature
    stays stable as more knobs come online.

    Field groups:

    - **Output layout.** ``pixel_format`` picks the output frame layout;
      only ``yuv_i420_stacked_alpha`` ships the MODNet matte. ``bg_id``
      is required and must name an entry in the pipeline's background
      registry. The reserved value ``"transparent"`` skips bg compositing —
      pair with ``yuv_i420_stacked_alpha`` for clean alpha.
    - **Per-condition CFG weights.** The ``avtr1_decode`` engine fans out
      four condition passes (``past`` / ``self_audio`` / ``other_audio``
      / ``kp``); these three floats are how strongly each conditional
      pulls away from the unconditional ``past`` pass. They're broadcast
      across all ``latent_dim`` coords and passed as engine inputs each
      chunk, so retuning guidance no longer requires a rebuild.
    - **Progressive AR(1) noise.** ``noise_alpha`` and ``noise_trunc_z``
      were ``AVTR1MotionGenerator.__init__`` args; they live here
      now so a caller can vary them per chunk (e.g. ``noise_alpha=0``
      for independent frames).
    - **Streaming.** When ``stream_frames=True`` (default) the pipeline
      yields each frame as soon as decoder + putback + matting + pack +
      H2D finish for it (warp still runs once on the full chunk). When
      ``False`` the whole chunk is batched and all frames are packed in
      one H2D copy — lower latency to *last* frame, higher to *first*.
